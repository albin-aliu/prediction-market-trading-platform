## 💰 Understanding the Economics

### **How Trading Works:**

```
1. Market: "Will Trump win 2024?"
   - YES price: $0.65
   - NO price: $0.35
   - Total always = $1.00

2. You buy 10 YES shares at $0.65
   - Cost: 10 × $0.65 = $6.50

3. Possible outcomes:
   
   IF YES WINS (Trump wins):
   - Your 10 YES shares → 10 USDC
   - Profit: $10.00 - $6.50 = $3.50 ✅
   
   IF NO WINS (Trump loses):
   - Your 10 YES shares → $0
   - Loss: -$6.50 ❌
```

### **Key Concepts:**

- **YES + NO always = $1.00** (per share pair)
- **Winners get $1.00 per share**
- **Losers get $0**
- **Prices reflect probability:**
  - YES at $0.65 = Market thinks 65% chance
  - NO at $0.35 = Market thinks 35% chance

### **Problem: "Connect Wallet" doesn't work**

### **Problem: "Transaction failed"**
**Solution:**
- Check you have enough MATIC for gas

- Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask
- Wait a moment and try again

**Solution:**
- Check MetaMask for pending transactions
- Transaction might be processing (wait 30s)
- If stuck for >2 min, try speeding up in MetaMask
