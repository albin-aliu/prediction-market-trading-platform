# üöÄ Real Trading Setup Guide

Your platform now supports **REAL trading** on Polymarket using ultra-fast CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) integration!

## ‚ö° How It Works

- **Latency**: ~100-500ms per trade
- **Network**: Polygon (cheap gas, ~$0.01-0.05)
- **Method**: Off-chain order book (instant matching)
- **Payment**: USDC on Polygon

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. **Install MetaMask** (or compatible wallet)
   - Download: https://metamask.io/download/
   - Or use Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, etc.

### 2. **Get Polygon Network Setup**
   ```
   Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
   RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com
   Chain ID: 137
   Currency Symbol: MATIC
   Block Explorer: https://polygonscan.com
   ```
   MetaMask will auto-add this when you connect!

### 3. **Get USDC on Polygon**

   **Option A: Bridge from Ethereum**
   - Go to https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge
   - Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Polygon
   - Takes ~7-8 minutes
   - Cost: ~$10-30 in Ethereum gas

   **Option B: Buy Directly (Easiest)**
   - Use Coinbase: Buy USDC ‚Üí Send to Polygon network
   - Use Binance/Kraken: Withdraw USDC selecting Polygon network
   - Cost: Minimal withdrawal fees

   **Option C: On-Ramp Providers**
   - https://transak.com/ - Buy crypto with card
   - https://ramp.network/ - Buy USDC directly on Polygon

### 4. **Get MATIC for Gas**
   - You need ~$1-5 worth of MATIC for gas fees
   - Use Polygon Faucet (free, small amounts): https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Or swap some USDC for MATIC on Uniswap

## üîí Security

‚úÖ **Non-Custodial**: Your funds stay in YOUR wallet
‚úÖ **No API Keys**: Trading uses wallet signatures
‚úÖ **Open Source**: All contracts are verified
‚úÖ **You Control**: Disconnect anytime

## üéì Trading Tips

### **For Arbitrage:**
1. Keep $100-500 USDC ready
2. Enable notifications for price discrepancies
3. Use Market orders (fastest execution)
4. Place on both platforms simultaneously

### **For Regular Trading:**
1. Start with small amounts ($10-50)
2. Use Limit orders to control price
3. Monitor volume (higher = better liquidity)
4. Check resolution criteria before trading

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Failed"
- **Check MATIC balance**: Need gas for transactions
- **Check USDC balance**: Make sure you have enough
- **Check network**: Should be on Polygon (137)
- **Increase gas**: Try again with higher gas limit

### "Order Not Filling"
- **Limit price too aggressive**: Use Market order instead
- **Low liquidity**: Check market volume
- **Network congestion**: Wait 1-2 minutes and retry

### "Wallet Won't Connect"
- **Update MetaMask**: Make sure you're on latest version
- **Clear cache**: Refresh page
- **Try different browser**: Chrome/Brave work best
- **Check network**: Polygon RPC might be down, use backup

### "High Gas Fees"
- **Wrong network**: Should be Polygon ($0.02), not Ethereum ($50+)
- **Network congested**: Wait for lower traffic times
- **Adjust gas settings**: Use "Fast" not "Instant"

## üìä Example Trading Session

```
Initial Setup:
- Transfer $500 USDC to Polygon: $15 (one-time)
- Get $5 MATIC for gas: $5 (lasts ~200 trades)

Trading 50 shares (arb opportunity):
- Buy on Polymarket: $25 + $0.02 gas = $25.02
- Sell on Kalshi: $30 + $0.02 gas = $30.02
- Net Profit: $5 - $0.04 = $4.96
- Time: ~500ms total ‚ö°
```
